## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Use summary functions to assess the structure of a data frame.  
2. Us the select function of `dplyr` to build data frames restricted to variable of interest.  
3. Use the `rename()` function to provide new, consistent names to variables in data frames.  

## Load the tidyverse
For the remainder of the quarter, we will work within the `tidyverse`. At the start of each lab, the library needs to be loaded as shown below.  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
```

## Load the data
These data are from: Gaeta J., G. Sass, S. Carpenter. 2012. Biocomplexity at North Temperate Lakes LTER: Coordinated Field Studies: Large Mouth Bass Growth 2006. Environmental Data Initiative.  [link](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-ntl&identifier=267)  
```{r}
fish <- readr::read_csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv") #cite where the data is from, readr=being explicit about the data we are using
```

## Data Structure
Once data have been uploaded, let's get an idea of its structure, contents, and dimensions.  
```{r}
glimpse(fish)
summary(fish)
```

## Tidyverse
The [tidyverse](www.tidyverse.org) is an "opinionated" collection of packages that make workflow in R easier. The packages operate more intuitively than base R commands and share a common organizational philosophy. #every varible is in its own column, every observation is in it's own row, and every value is in one cell. 
![*Data Science Workflow in the Tidyverse.*](tidy-1.png)  

## dplyr
The first package that we will use that is part of the tidyverse is `dplyr`. `dplyr` is used to transform data frames by extracting, rearranging, and summarizing data such that they are focused on a question of interest. This is very helpful,  especially when wrangling large data, and makes dplyr one of most frequently used packages in the tidyverse. The two functions we will use most are `select()` and `filter()`.  #dplyr allows you to take a dataframe and chop it up in a way you need to make it tidy.

## `select()`
Select allows you to pull out columns of interest from a dataframe. To do this, just add the names of the columns to the `select()` command. The order in which you add them, will determine the order in which they appear in the output.
```{r}
names(fish) #shows us 6 different columns
```

We are only interested in lakeid and scalelength.
```{r}
select(fish, "lakeid", "scalelength") #allows you to just pull out those columns, select(name of dataframe and the columns you want), fish is not a column so it is not in quotes
```

```{r}
names(fish)
```

```{r}
fish_subset<- select(fish, "fish_id", "length") #reversing length and fishid, it's going to give it in the reverse way #fishsubset chops up the dataframe and now we have it in our environment
```


To add a range of columns use `start_col:end_col`.
```{r}
select(fish, fish_id:length)# fish_id:length gives us the data in the columns from fish_id to length
```

The - operator is useful in select. It allows us to select everything except the specified variables.
```{r}
select(fish, -fish_id, -annnumber, -length, -radii_length_mm) #- operator selects everything except the specified variables
```

For very large data frames with lots of variables, `select()` utilizes lots of different operators to make things easier. Let's say we are only interested in the variables that deal with length.

```{r}
names(fish)
```

```{r}
select(fish, contains("length")) #pulls out data that contains the work length
```

When columns are sequentially named, `starts_with()` makes selecting columns easier.
```{r}
select(fish, starts_with("radii")) #pull out all the variables that start with "radii"
```

Options to select columns based on a specific criteria include:  
1. ends_with() = Select columns that end with a character string  
2. contains() = Select columns that contain a character string  
3. matches() = Select columns that match a regular expression 
4. one_of() = Select columns names that are from a group of names  

```{r}
names(fish)
```

```{r}
select(fish, ends_with("id"))
```

```{r}
select(fish, contains("fish"))
```

We won't cover regular expressions [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) in this class, but the following code is helpful when you know that a column contains a letter (in this case "a") followed by a subsequent string (in this case "er").  
```{r}
select(fish, matches("a.+er")) #handy bit of code for the project, start with an a and ends with an er
```

You can also select columns based on the class of data.  
```{r}
glimpse(fish)
```

```{r}
select_if(fish, is.numeric) #pull out all the numerics
```

To select all columns that are *not* a class of data, you need to add a `~`.
```{r}
select_if(fish, ~!is.numeric(.)) #look into fish and pull out everything that is not numeric, select if in the fish data look in all cells and don't pull out the ones that are numeric, exclamation point (!) means not, so if you take it away, it will give you all the numeric variables
```

## Practice  
For this exercise we will use life history data `mammal_lifehistories_v2.csv` for mammals. The [data](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/093/) are from:  
**S. K. Morgan Ernest. 2003. Life history characteristics of placental non-volant mammals. Ecology 84:3402.**  

Load the data.  
```{r}
mammals_new<- read_csv("data/mammal_lifehistories_v2.csv") #how to load data, using read_csv, it is already a dataframe, do not use data.frame after that because it is already a dataframe. We have to tell R where the data is, inside the data folder is where the mammals data are (we have to specify the path)
```

1. Use one or more of your favorite functions to assess the structure of the data.  
```{r}
glimpse(mammals)
summary(mammals)
```

2. Are there any NAs? Are you sure? Try taking an average of `max. life` as a test.  

```{r}
anyNA(mammals)
```

```{r}
summary(mammals)
```

```{r}
mean(mammals$`max. life`)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

3. What are the names of the columns in the `mammals` data?
```{r}
names(mammals)
```

4. Rename any columns that have capitol letters or punctuation issues.  
```{r}
mammals_new <- rename(mammals, genus="Genus", wean_mass="wean mass", max_life="max. life", litter_size="litter size", litters_per_year="litters/year")
```

5. We are only interested in the variables `genus`, `species`, and `mass`. Use `select()` to build a new dataframe `mass` focused on these variables.
```{r}
mass <- select(mammals_new, "genus", "species", "mass")
```

```{r}
names(mammals_new)
```

6. What if we only wanted to exclude `order` and `family`? Use the `-` operator to make the code efficient.
```{r}
select(mammals_new, -order, -family)
```

7. Select the columns that include "mass" as part of the name.  
```{r}
select(mammals_new, contains("mass"))
```

8. Select all of the columns that are of class `character`.  
```{r}
select_if(mammals_new, ~is.character)
```

## Other
Here are two examples of code that are super helpful to have in your bag of tricks.  

Imported data frames often have a mix of lower and uppercase column names. Use `toupper()` or `tolower()` to fix this issue. I always try to use lowercase to keep things consistent.  

```{r}
select_all(mammals, tolower)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
names(mammals)
```

```{r}
clean_names(mammals)
```

When naming columns, blank spaces are often added (don't do this, please). Here is a trick to remove these.  
```{r}
#select_all(mammals, ~str_replace(., " ", "_"))
```

## That's it! Let's take a break and then move on to part 2!
