##1. load the fish data

```{r}
getwd()
```


```{r}
fish<- read.csv("data/gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```

2. transform fish data to include only variables lakeid and length
```{r}
select(fish, "lakeid", "length") #pulls out the columns only, it reshapes the dataframe and makes it small
```

3. filter the fish data to include only samples from lake BO

```{r}
glimpse(fish) #to see what lass lakeid is in
```


```{r}
fish_bo<- filter(fish, lakeid == "BO") #filter, pulls out variables of interest from a dataframe
```

4. Calculate mean length of fish from lake BO

```{r}
mean(fish_bo$length)
```
