```

## Instructions
This homework is a bit less traditional this week. There are some errors in the code below. In addition add notes and titles to the code chunks that explains what the code chunck does. Use AI tools, notes from class, or any other resources to help fix the errors. Feel free to edit any plots to your preference. Don't forget to answer the two questions at the bottom. Upon completion, you should not have to '#' out any of the code chunks.

Push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove the `#` for the included code chunks to run. Be sure to add your name to the author header above.   

Again make sure to use the formatting conventions of RMarkdown to make your report neat and clean!  


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
```


1.
```{r}
blood_count <- read_csv("data/blood_count_dataset.csv") %>%  clean_names()
```

2. 
```{r}
glimpse(blood_count)
```

3. 
```{r}
blood_count %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarize(min = min(red_blood_cells),
            mean = mean(red_blood_cells),
            max = max(red_blood_cells))
```


4. 
```{r}
options(scipen = 999, digits = 2)

blood_count %>%
  filter(gender == "male") %>%
  select(3:9) %>%
  colMeans(na.rm = TRUE)

```

5. 
```{r}
blood_count %>%
  filter(gender == "Female") %>%
  select(3:9) %>%
  colMeans(na.rm = TRUE)
```


6. 
```{r}

blood_count %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:9, names_to = "Test", values_to = "Values") %>% #instead of pivot wider, is pivot longer
  ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = Values, fill = gender)) + #lowercase g for gender
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ Test, scales = "free") + #add wrap
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Blood Count Tests",
       x = "Test",
       y = "Values")

```

7. 
```{r}
grouped_bc <- blood_count %>%
  mutate(Age_Group = case_when( #changed "change" to mutate
    age >= 20 & age <= 29 ~ "20s",#fixed spelling for age
    age >= 30 & age <= 39 ~ "30s",
    age >= 40 & age <= 49 ~ "40s",
    age >= 50 & age <= 59 ~ "50s",
    age >= 60 & age <= 70 ~ "60s")) # there were only 4 people in 70s, so I combined it with 60s

head(grouped_bc)

```

8. 
```{r}
grouped_bc %>% #changed blood_count to grouped_bc
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:9, names_to = "Test", values_to = "Values") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age_Group, y = Values, fill = Age_Group)) + #changed ase to aes, and uppercased V
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~Test, scales = "free") +  # Facet by the "Test" variable
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Blood Count Tests by Age Group",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Values")

```
9. What are two drawbacks and two benefits of AI?

One drawback of AI is it will not know exactly what you are trying to ask every time. Another drawback of AI is that it can misintrpret your data. 

One benefit of AI is it is able to assume what you are going to do before you even do it, 90% of the time. This leads to our second benefit, AI makes coders faster and more efficient. 

10. Do you think you will use AI for coding in the future? Why or why not?

I will definitely be using AI for coding in the future because it can not only help me fix my codes but makes me faster at coding. 

## Push your final code to GitHub!
Please be sure that you check the `keep md` file in the knit preferences.
